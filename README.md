# Monkey-Dungeon
Written in my own game engine utilizing OpenTK as the graphics library. 
Future additions for audio down the road.

Monkey Dungeon is a mix between a JRPG and multiplayer party game. 

Players in groups up to four, work together to traverse as far as they
can into the Monkey Dungeon. Class load outs, and skill synergies is
key in getting as far as possible in Monkey Dungeon.
